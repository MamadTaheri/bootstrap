                  Khalid Hosseini writes in the wind of the wind: the little man whispered in the ears of his newly
                  mature child's ear: 'My son, you never rob you of life.' The boy looked at the father with
                  astonishment, in the sense that he never had a crooked father. He looked smiling and continued: 'Do
                  not lie in your life, because if you said you stole honesty, do not betray if you have stolen love, do
                  not violate if you have stolen your love, do not tell if you You have stolen the right, do not despise
                  if you have stolen your honor ... so do not steal in life!
